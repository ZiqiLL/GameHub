# GameHub

## Introduction
GameHub is a dynamic web application designed to offer a seamless experience for game enthusiasts. Our platform enables users to effortlessly search for games based on various criteria such as name, genre, and platform. Currently, we have implemented the main page, which serves as the cornerstone of our application. Looking ahead, we are excited about introducing new features, including the ability for users to comment or post game strategies under each game listing. This will foster a vibrant community of gamers sharing insights and experiences.

## Tech Stack
In building GameHub, we've leveraged some of the latest and most efficient technologies in web development. Our dynamic UI is crafted using React and TypeScript, ensuring a robust and scalable application. To populate our site with a vast array of game data, we've integrated the RAWG API, tapping into its extensive database. Furthermore, we've utilized Chakra UI, a modern React framework, for its collection of pre-built components that enhance the aesthetic and functionality of our site.
