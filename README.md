## Introduction
GameHub is a dynamic web application designed to offer a seamless experience for game enthusiasts. This platform enables users to effortlessly search for games based on various criteria such as name, genre, and platform. Currently, I have implemented the main page, which serves as the cornerstone of the application. Looking ahead, I am excited about introducing new features, including the ability for users to comment or post game strategies under each game listing. This will foster a vibrant community of gamers sharing insights and experiences.

## Tech Stack
In building GameHub, I've leveraged some of the latest and most efficient technologies in web development. The dynamic UI is crafted using React and TypeScript, ensuring a robust and scalable application. To populate the site with a vast array of game data, I've integrated the RAWG API, tapping into its extensive database. Furthermore, I've utilized Chakra UI, a modern React framework, for its collection of pre-built components that enhance the aesthetic and functionality of our site.
